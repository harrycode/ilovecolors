I don't pretend to own this game.
It's just another way to see the environment around me.
It's not about the anger, but about the happy and sad.
Think of all of the times you've ever lost something.
Think of all of the times you've ever been hurt.
This game is about remembering the better part.
This game is about letting the worse part go.
Just focus on what you can make better.
Just focus on what is present now.
Let go of what you couldn't keep.
Let in those who want to help.
This is how I could cope.
This is how I let go.
